The [Rosetta Commons](https://www.rosettacommons.org/) under the Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is dedicated to advancing molecular sciences through open science and open-source research software. We are seeking an innovative and driven Technical Product Lead to drive the development, maintenance, and optimization of our Rosetta software for biomolecular modeling and design. The primary goal of this role is to develop and transform existing tools into easy-to-use, well-documented, and thoroughly tested software products that meet the needs of a diverse scientific community. The ideal candidate will have a strong technical background, leadership experience, and a passion for advancing computational tools in the field of molecular sciences. This includes:

* **Strategic vision and implementation**: Develop and implement a strategic vision for Rosetta software, align development with organizational goals, and actively contribute to roadmap planning and execution.  
* **Project management and maintenance**: Oversee and directly contribute to all stages of the software lifecycle, manage key projects, and ensure long-term maintainability through regular updates and best practices.  
* **Interoperability and user interfaces**: Ensure seamless integration with external tools, directly contribute to the development of user-friendly interfaces and APIs, and enhance accessibility and usability.  
* **Software development and optimization**: Actively participate in designing, developing, and maintaining high-quality, scalable software solutions while incorporating the latest advancements in molecular sciences and software engineering.  
* **Community support and documentation:** Provide technical support to contributors and end-users, foster collaboration by sharing best practices and encouraging contributions. Maintain comprehensive documentation to facilitate knowledge transfer and improve usability.

This role is a **fully remote position with flexibility in work location and schedule.** The initial term is for up to two years, contingent on available funding, with the possibility of extension depending on future funding availability. Since this position is largely grant-funded, **you will need to be legally authorized to live and work in the United States**. If your visa is sponsored by your current employer, please apply and leave a note that you may require visa assistance. **We will not accept overseas applications for this role.**

Please note that, depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences. Our teams and collaborators are mostly based in the United States and in Europe. **This role offers a high degree of autonomy, allowing you to structure your work in a way that best suits your productivity.** This role will require occasional travel for work.

The Tech Lead will work closely with the Rosetta Commons' leadership team, stakeholders, and internal and external users and developers of the software that share the common goal of improving molecular sciences through open science and open source research software. This is a newly established centralized professional role in the organization complementing our academic distribution model. This role offers many opportunities to shape up our community and the role itself, and a driven and resourceful individual would be best suited for the role. The ideal candidate is a proactive and engaging individual with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, capable of maintaining attention to detail in a dynamic work environment. The Tech Lead will report to the OpenRosetta Project Director and will be supported by the technical staff in the Rosetta Commons.
