The [Rosetta Commons](https://www.rosettacommons.org/) under the Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is dedicated to advancing molecular sciences through open science and open-source research software. We are seeking a Documentation Writer to update, create and maintain comprehensive, clear, and effective documentation. The Documentation Writer's duties will center around managing, designing and improving all aspects of documentation and tutorials of Rosetta and adjacent biomolecular modeling and design tools for both users and developers inside and outside of our organization. The Documentation Writer will work relentlessly to improve the clarity of documentation and tutorials and accessibility of information and resources to our projects and communities. This includes:

* **Conduct tool usage research:** Perform usage research to identify the most popular tools, guiding the prioritization of documentation updates.  
* **Restructure and update documentation**: Evaluate, reorganize, streamline, and update existing documentation to improve accessibility and archive outdated content.   
* **Create documentation for new tools:** Develop clear, instructional content for new tools and features, helping users maximize new functionalities.  
* **Integrate into our Educational Hub:** Integrate documentation into our Education Hub, a unified resource that supports diverse user needs and promotes seamless learning experiences.  
* **Support users and workshop leaders:** Provide ongoing support to users and educational workshop leaders by offering tailored documentation and tutorials. 

This role is a **fully remote position with flexibility in work location and schedule.** The initial term is for up to two years, contingent on available funding, with the possibility of extension depending on future funding availability. Since this position is largely grant-funded, **you will need to be legally authorized to live and work in the United States**. If your visa is sponsored by your current employer, please apply and leave a note that you may require visa assistance. **We will not accept overseas applications for this role.**

Please note that, depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences. Our teams and collaborators are mostly based in the United States and in Europe. **This role offers a high degree of autonomy, allowing you to structure your work in a way that best suits your productivity.** This role will require occasional travel for work.

The Documentation Writer will work closely with the Rosetta Commons' leadership team, stakeholders, and internal and external users and developers of the software that share the common goal of improving molecular sciences through open science and open source research software. This is a new role in the organization offering many opportunities to shape up our community and the role itself, and a driven and resourceful individual would be best suited for the role. The ideal candidate is a proactive and engaging individual with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, capable of maintaining attention to detail in a dynamic work environment. The Documentation Writer will report to the OpenRosetta Project Director and will be supported by the technical staff in the Rosetta Commons.
