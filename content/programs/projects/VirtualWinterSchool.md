## Virtual Winter School on Computational Chemistry

Not everyone can travel to scientific conferences due to financial constraints, health concerns, family responsibilities, or teaching commitments. These barriers often disproportionately impact women with young children, but many others also benefit from a virtual format that removes these obstacles.

The Virtual Winter School on Computational Chemistry are committed to offering an alternative to these classical models. Offering a week long course in the winter, VWSCC gives its participants a comprehensive walkthrough through the basics and best practices in computational chemistry.

Virtual lectures offer a sustainable alternative, allowing participants to engage from home without the need for travel. Recorded sessions also provide flexibility, enabling attendees to watch at their convenience. To ensure accessibility, the Virtual Winter School offers free registration, making scientific content available to researchers worldwide, regardless of financial, health, or family circumstances.

Additionally, the online format enhances global collaboration, fostering connections among peers from different regions. Our goal is to create a dynamic platform that supports international dialogue in computational chemistry and interdisciplinary exchange. To make the content accessible to a broad audience, we encourage speakers to include introductory material in their presentations.
