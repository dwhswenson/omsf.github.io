OMSF: A Home for Open Science Collaboration
The Open Molecular Software Foundation provides a home for open-source projects in computational molecular sciences. Already hosting a plethora of such projects, OMSF streamlines operations, fosters collaboration, and maximizes funding efficiency—allowing researchers and developers to focus on their science, not administrative overhead.

Why OMSF?
- We provide a collaborative, connected, global ecosystem where projects and experts can communicate and collaborate.
- From accounting and human resources to best practices in governance and community building, we help projects operate smoothly.
- OMSF provides a neutral, independent home, ensuring that projects aren't tied to a single developer or institution
- We offer proven governance frameworks and support models, reducing the friction of both launching and maintaining impactful projects.
- Through OMSF, projects gain access to our community of potential funders, users, and collaborators, increasing project reach, visibility and impact.

OMSF achieves efficiencies in administration and funding, reducing the burden on individual projects while effectively managing consortium funding, tax considerations, and operational logistics. This allows hosted projects to focus on their mission while benefiting from centralized expertise and infrastructure.

OMSF also provides support to those wishing to promote their own molecular science communities. Whether it be organizing events, educating, or showing the best in class, OMSF provides a proven method for in-person and remote organizations to host webinars, in-person meetings, or community gatherings.
