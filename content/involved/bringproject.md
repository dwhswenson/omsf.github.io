The core of the Open Molecular Software Foundation is its hosted projects - groups of talented people that drive innovation, foster collaboration, and contribute to our broader ecosystem.  

Hosting your project with OMSF means aligning with our commitment to open science and open-source principles while benefiting from an established infrastructure for funding management, governance, and community support.
To begin, consider:  
- How your project fits within the computational molecular sciences domain.  
- Your commitment to open-source licensing and public code availability.  
- Your governance model and how decisions will be made within your project.  
- Your plan for financial sustainability, including potential funding sources.
  
OMSF ensures that hosted projects receive the administrative support needed to focus on scientific and technical advancements rather than operational overhead. If interested, check out [What We Do](https://omsf.io/resources/fiscalsponsorship/).

We are happy to work with you in structuring your proposal. If interested in hosting your project at OMSF, reach us at [info@omsf.io](info@omsf.io).
