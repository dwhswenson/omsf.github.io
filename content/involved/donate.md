OMSF and it's hosted projects enjoy the support of many mission-driven philanthropic organizations. These contributions not only fuel groundbreaking projects but also help build a robust and interconnected scientific community. We are grateful for their significant contirbutions to our cause.  

Philanthropic organizations provide critical support in several key areas:
- **Sustainability**: Grants and donations help ensure our project's long-term impact and accessibility.
- **Capacity Building**: Contributions to OMSF help support training and mentorship programs that strengthen the global research ecosystem.
- **Community and Collaboration**: Philanthropy fuels events, workshops, and community-building initiatives that foster collaboration between our community of academic researchers, industry professionals, and software developers.

OMSF also recognizes that time is one of the most valuable gifts someone can offer. Our projects thrive thanks to the dedication of individual contributors who invest their time and expertise. Without their efforts, the quality and impact of OMSFâ€™s software initiatives would not reach the high standards we strive to achieve.  

If you have contributed to our projects in any way, **we thank you** for your support and commitment to open science.  

If your foundation is interested in aligning with OMSF, we invite you to connect with us at [info@omsf.io](info@omsf.io).
